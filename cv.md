### About Myself:
I’m just starting my path leading to the goal of becoming a front-end developer. I am on maternity leave now, so I have plenty of free time to study on the RS Scholl’s JavaScript/Front-end courses. My job isn’t related to IT sphere absolutely. I finished university in 2017 and I am a lawyer by specialty. I was working as a bailiff. At the beginning of 2021, I have completed manual testing online course by IT Start UP. The more I got into the details of profession of QA-Engineer the better I realised that I want to move in another direction. Also, I do my best to improve my English level.
